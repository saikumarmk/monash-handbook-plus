This allows you to further enhance your knowledge and skills in a specific area of engineering that complements your main field of study.<br /><br />Option 2: You may consider engineering technical units listed across the engineering minors, subject to meeting the unit prerequisite or co-requisite rules. This will allow you to tailor your studies and broaden your knowledge within the field of engineering while still aligning with your chosen specialisation.<br /><br />Note: To enrol in a Level 5 unit listed below, you must be in your final year and have a weighted average mark (WAM) of 65 or above at the conclusion of 3rd Year.",
