# Monash Handbook Visualizer

A better way to explore the Monash University handbook - with proper requisite visualization, "what does this unit unlock" views, and cost information.

## Features

- **Unit Search**: Search and filter units by code, name, school, level, and cost band
- **Unit Details**: View prerequisites, corequisites, and what units are unlocked
- **Cost Calculator**: See estimated costs based on SCA bands
- **Areas of Study**: Browse majors and minors with hierarchical requirement trees
- **Courses**: Explore full degrees and their requirements
- **Graph View**: Interactive force-directed graph showing unit relationships
- **Planner**: Build and track your study plan with running totals

## Setup

### Quick Setup (Windows)

Double-click `setup.bat` or run:
```bash
.\setup.bat
```

### Manual Setup

1. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pnpm install
   ```

2. Copy data files from `../monash_hbpp/data/` to `public/data/`:
   ```bash
   # Windows
   mkdir public\data
   copy ..\monash_hbpp\data\processed_units.json public\data\
   copy ..\monash_hbpp\data\parsed_aos_full.json public\data\
   copy ..\monash_hbpp\data\parsed_courses_full.json public\data\
   
   # Linux/Mac
   mkdir -p public/data
   cp ../monash_hbpp/data/*.json public/data/
   ```

3. Generate network data:
   ```bash
   node scripts/setup-data.js
   ```

4. Start the development server:
   ```bash
   pnpm dev
   ```

The app will be available at http://localhost:5173

## Data Sources

The app uses JSON data files that should be placed in `public/data/`:

- `processed_units.json` - Unit information including requisites
- `parsed_aos_full.json` - Areas of Study (majors/minors)
- `parsed_courses_full.json` - Full course/degree information
- `network.json` - Pre-computed graph data (generated by setup script)

## Tech Stack

- React 19 + TypeScript
- Vite
- TailwindCSS v4
- React Router
- Zustand (state management)
- react-force-graph (graph visualization)

## Development

```bash
# Install dependencies
pnpm install

# Start dev server
pnpm dev

# Build for production
pnpm build

# Preview production build
pnpm preview
```

## Testing

The project uses Vitest for unit testing.

```bash
# Run tests in watch mode
pnpm test

# Run tests once
pnpm test:run

# Run tests with coverage
pnpm test:coverage
```

### Test Structure

- `src/types/index.test.ts` - Tests for utility functions (getUnitCost, getUnitLevel, getFacultyPrefix)
- `src/stores/plannerStore.test.ts` - Tests for the planner state management
